# ubirch#1 r0.3-k (Kokeshi) board specific implementation

This is the ubirch#1 board revision 0.3 (special version k0.1, Kokeshi).
This board contains almost the same components as the r0.2 with a different cell-chip (Quectel M66)
and no extra ECC chip. Additionally components, such as extra LEDs, a PIR, SDHC slot, and audio hardware.

* programmable via USB or JTAG (SWD, JLink Debug Probe)
* serial debug console is configured on PTB16 (RX) and PTB17 (TX)

## Flashing

Entering bootloader mode:
1. __Initial__ (necessary once): The board must be reset into bootloader mode. This is done by removing the USB/Power, then pressing
the button on-board (keep pressed) and re-inserting the USB cable. Now the board is in bootloader mode.
2. __Firmware__: After flashing using the latest firmware entering the bootloader mode is just a
matter of pressing the button once.

If you use the [cmake build toolchain](https://github.com/ubirch/ubirch-arm-toolchain), the `-flash` target for your
project will be configured to use the `blhost` tool coming with the toolchain to flash directly via USB.

The commands it executes are:

- `blhost -u -- flash-erase-all`
- `blhost -u -- write-memory 0x0 target-executable.bin`
- `blhost -u -- reset`

These commands, erase flash, write the binary and reset the board.

## Connectors

Debug console output can be found on pins 6 (RX) and 7 (TX). If the USB port is at the bottom,
then pin 1 is in the top right corner of the board
